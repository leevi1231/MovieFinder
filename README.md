**MovieFinder** is an app for discovering movies and series, allowing users to add ratings and reviews to their profiles. It also lets you view other users' profiles and see their ratings.

The app is built with **React Native** using the **Expo** toolset. It utilizes the **OMDB (Open Movie Database) API** for fetching movie data and **SQLite** for user authentication and data storage. React Native Core Components make up most of the application structure, with navigation being managed by **React Navigation**. UI icons are provided by **Expo's Icon Library**.
